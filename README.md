the files should be in order of; 
Initial SASI sorting
IACS model construction
Dataset construction 


The goal of these snippets is to create a dataframe (excel sheet or Pandas dataframe - whatever is prefered)
to be the starting point of anaysis of the data. 
This should be in the shape of Columns for included data - sample data and ley frequency for the total sum of years - and the all the crops for included years
